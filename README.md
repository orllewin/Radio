# Radio PWA

This is a [KotlinJS](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/js-overview.html) [PWA](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) that consumes the [Orllewin](https://orllewin.uk/) radio [JSON feed](https://orllewin.uk/default_stations.json) which was originally created for a [Jetpack Compose investigation project](https://github.com/orllewin/RAD).
